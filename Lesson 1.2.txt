Practice 1.2

Lab 1.2.1: Recreate the Bucket with Public Data
------------------------------------------------
The contents of data directory along with private.txt was uploaded using sync command. Along with the object of
bucket made publicly readable by executing following command:

$ aws s3 sync .  s3://izaan-wali1317 --acl public-read

Then it was verified whether it is publicly available or not by the following command:

$ curl https://izaan-wali1317.s3.amazonaws.com/test1.txt
WALI UR RASHID

Question: After this, can you download one of your files from the bucket without using
your API credentials?

Ans: Yes, we can download file without API credential.

Lab 1.2.2: Use the CLI to Restrict Access to Private Data
----------------------------------------------------------

"private.txt" file was made protected using following command:

$ aws s3 cp private.txt s3://izaan-wali1317 --acl private

Question: How could you use "aws s3 cp" or "aws s3 sync" command to modify the
permissions on the file?

Ans: To modify this sort of permissions we have to use "aws s3 cp"

Question: Is there a way you can change the permissions on the file without re-uploading?

Ans: Yes, we can change the permission in the file without re-uploading by fillowing command:

$ aws s3api put-object-acl --bucket izaan-wali1317 --key private.txt --acl public-read

Lab 1.2.3: Using the API from the CLI
--------------------------------------

Created a Bucket using s3api

$ aws s3api create-bucket --bucket izaan-wali1318

Then created a json file named policy.json for the required permission and executed the following command:

$ aws s3api put-bucket-policy --bucket izaan-wali1318 --policy file://policy.json
